#Lexigram Knowlegde Graph - Search Feature

### Development Environment:

- OS: Linux - Ubutnu
- Text Editor: Sublime


### Technologies:
- HTML
- CSS (including Skeleton library)
- Javascript / jQuery



### Time Line:
(Total: less than 4hours)

- studying the api and learning about lexgiram.io's style : ~30 min

 my Goal was to keep the branding consistent between the main website and this feature. I tried to use the same color scheme that is being used in the main website. Lexigram is using skeleton library for responsive layouts and this was my first time using this library.Therefore I spend about 15 min reading/learning Skeleton's guid.

- brain storimg and wireframes: ~ 30 min
